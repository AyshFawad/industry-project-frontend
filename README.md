- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: A server-side JavaScript environment for handling API requests and server logic.
  - Express: A web application framework for Node.js to manage routes and simplify server-side development.
  
## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Users fill in a series of financial data points in user-friendly forms (e.g., income, savings, expenses).
2. **Score Calculation**: The backend processes this data, applying the necessary algorithms to compute a financial wellness score.
3. **Results Visualization**: Once the score is calculated, interactive graphs display the results and offer recommendations for improving financial wellness.
4. **Engagement**: Users can track their financial wellness score over time, making it easier to stay engaged and take action.
